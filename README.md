TEACHING IN 10 MINUTES: PYTHON LIST COMPREHENSIONS

I created a web application for my User Interface Design class, primarily focusing on frontend development, to teach users how to master Python list comprehensions in just 10 minutes. The app includes video tutorials with embedded questions, a quick guide on their usage, interactive coding exercises, and a final quiz. The quiz features a video-based question, a drag-and-drop activity to match code snippets, and a coding challenge where users must type in the correct solution. Users receive immediate feedback, with a score of 2/3 or higher considered a passing grade, while anything below requires further study and retrying the quiz.

Lessons Learned
Using Flask for Backend Development:

I gained experience setting up a simple web server with Flask, creating routes, rendering HTML templates, and managing user sessions. This project reinforced my knowledge of how to build a dynamic web application with Python.
Implementing Interactive Learning Modules:

Building an interactive platform required me to think through how users engage with educational content. I learned how to structure lessons using videos, quizzes, and coding exercises to optimize learning experiences.
Designing Intuitive User Interfaces:

By working on the frontend, I explored different UI design principles such as layout organization, visual feedback, and navigation flow, which helped me create a more user-friendly and engaging experience.
Session and State Management:

I used Flask sessions to maintain user state and track progress throughout the course. This taught me how to manage application state across multiple routes and ensure that user data is handled properly.

Skills Gained
Frontend Development with HTML/CSS:

I improved my skills in creating structured and visually appealing interfaces, using custom CSS for layout, styling buttons, and integrating video elements.
Backend Development with Flask:

I enhanced my ability to create RESTful endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and process server-side logic to support the frontend features of the web app.
Creating Interactive Quizzes and Code Validation:

I learned to implement quiz logic, validate user inputs, and provide real-time feedback using both frontend and backend code.

Problems Faced
Managing User State Across Different Quiz Sections:

Keeping track of user progress across different pages was challenging. Using sessions helped, but required careful planning to ensure state consistency.
Designing an Intuitive Drag-and-Drop Interface:

Creating a smooth drag-and-drop quiz required figuring out how to visually highlight user interactions and validate answers in a way that was intuitive and responsive.
Handling Variations in User-Submitted Code:

Comparing user-submitted code with expected answers while accounting for small syntax variations was a challenge. I had to normalize inputs to ensure the validation process was accurate and user-friendly.
